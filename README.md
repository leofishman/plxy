# PLXY Hardhat Project

PLXY provides cross-game utility as outlined previously, and purposely circular shared
protocol revenue, as it allows creators and players to benefit from everything they build
or earn in-game.
 It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat run --network <network-name> scripts/deploy.ts
```
